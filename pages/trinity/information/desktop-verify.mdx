There are a few ways to verify the authenticity of Trinity Desktop. This helps
you ensure that your copy of the app is the same as the one that was uploaded to GitHub.
By following the steps below, you can ensure that your copy was not corrupted
or otherwise tampered with.

### Windows

* Verify the SHA256 hash:
    1. Open Command Prompt
    2. Run `certUtil -hashfile path\\to\\trinity-desktop-version.exe SHA256` (for example,
    if the exe for Trinity 0.3.2 is in `C:\\Users\\yourname\\Downloads`, run
     `certUtil -hashfile C:\\Users\\yourname\\Downloads\\trinity-desktop-0.3.2.exe SHA256`)
        1. Verify that the hash in the [release notes](https://github.com/iotaledger/trinity-wallet/releases/latest)
        matches the output shown in Command Prompt

* Verify the code signature:
    1. Right-click on trinity-desktop-version.exe
    2. Click the "Digital Signatures" tab, then click "Details", then click "View Certificate"
        a. In the "Certification Path" tab, ensure that the the following information matches the path shown on your screen:
            i. DigiCert
            ii. DigiCert SHA2 Assured Code Signing CA
            iii. IOTA Stiftung
        b. Ensure that "Certificate status" says "This certificate is OK."
